## MyAccountOdoo

# Description

The main goal of this Odoo module is to show the status of my account at the end of the month, giving a list of expenses (planned or done).

The feature I prefer (and it's also the reason why I created this module) is the calendar view : it is designed for showing you all the expenses on the current month, and for one expense, the account's total at this date. It allows you to know if you will be able to eat something else than pasta the next week and you won't be ruined...

# Features
